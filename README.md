just all of my random crap can go here

# config
because wsl2 is supported, I'm running windows 11 with WSL2.

I'm running Ubuntu variety. and quick start currently looks like this:

1. `windows key` + `x` and then `i` to open windows terminal
2. `cd repos/flarn-odin` to enter this repository
3. `windows key` + `s` and then `vs` enter to open vscode
4. click the little blue rectangle at the bottom and connect to wsl in vscode
5. `ctrl` + `o` to open the directory path and type `/repos/flarn-odin` 

I currently am struggling with the `code .` command to open the repo in vs code
So then I need to open up vs code separately, which is annoying.
It would be cool to whittle the above 5 steps to 3, but `code .` isn't playing nice.
